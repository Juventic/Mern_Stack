Our goal is to build a web chat that holds a single chat room. 
Any user can connect to it from an open window/tab, 
 each connected user will see instantly any message sent, 
and new connected users will see the last 10 messages sent.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The web app will be consist of 2 parts, the client and the server.
The client will contain 2 main components: 
a login form, where the user can write a use name to use for the chat throughout the conversation. 
The second component will consist of the chat messages, 
where each message that is sent, is viewed from anyone thatâ€™s connected to the chat room.
The server will accept two type of connections: 
 By creating an account, 
 The second connection the server manages is a WebSocket port to manage 
incoming connections and broadcast messages to all connected clients, in real time.
As we expect a large volume of data to be written to the database in a short amount of
 time and the data that we save are unstructured, it makes sense to use a NoSQL type of database. 
For this application, we will be using MongoDB.
