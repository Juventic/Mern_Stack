Phase 2 - Project
------------------------ToDo List App-----------------------------------------------------------

This Project we build a ToDo List App using:
. Visual Studio Code
. React
. Redux
. Hooks
. Metrial for CSS
.Git
.GitHub
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How it works?

This App is designed for users that want a list for the tasks they want to accomblish through out the day.

In the app the user asked to insert a task where it can be add to ToDo task list

The user can view the list

The user can check the desired task among completion

Also the user is optioned to delete the tasks

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The process in developing ToDo List:

The app consisit of:
App.js
App.css
ToDo.js
TodoForm.js
TodoList.js

Note: I decided to do more work on the project by using Hooks to use useEffect(); 
so now whenever the user refresh the page the list of tasks will not be deleted 
it will only be deleted when the user click on the close button

Also i decided to go for "Meterial-ui" for CSS I was introduced to Meterial-ui functions to make
the app looks cooler
it was intersting to learn so I decided why not use it on this app as well
